Ask a designer whats most important and he will say something that will roughly translate to “good design” whether it be UX, UI, or some other form or design. Ask a developer and he will tell you that neither of these things matter if your websites code is wonky, if it doesn’t function right.</p>\n<p>So what am I here to tell you that these three disciplines wont? Well that’s simple. <strong>They’re all right.</strong> That’s right you need all of these things and many others to get the most out of your website.</p>\n<p>Often you’ll see people spend thousands of dollars on the design and development of their website but nothing on the promotion or marketing of it.</p>\n<p>You will have to excuse my ignorance of fine art here.

One of, if not the worlds most famous painting would be worth as much if after da Vinci’s death in 1519 whoever inherited this painting shoved it in a closet along with the rest of Leonardo’s paintings never to be seen by the world again? I doubt it, sure I imagine at some point someone would have found them dragged them out and put them on display but I doubt it would be as famous or worth as much as it is today.</p>\n<p>We aren’t here to talk about paintings though. We want to talk about website. What I am really trying to get at here is that you need a well rounded approach to your website. Spending thousands of 💲 💲 💲 on a designer and developer will do you no good if no one sees your website. Likewise a brilliantly marketed website with thousands of visitors every day hitting it will never be as effective if it’s design, and user experience is horrible. It should be noted here that if your business sucks none of these things will help, a website and marketing can’t make up for a poor product or plan.</p>\n<p>So what am I saying to do? Simple a two step approach to your website.</p>\n<h4>Step 1</h4>\n<p>Figure out who your market is and design your website to capture their attention. You should probably have a solid idea of who your customers are and what they are looking for. Give your designer as much of this information as you can and if they are any good, pretty soon you will have a website that both looks good and captures your audience / clients attention. Don’t skimp on your developer either, sure it should be nice and simple but a good developer will ensure that your website works for years to come and doesn’t just break with the next update that comes along. They will also ensure that everything is modular and well documented, making sure that in the future changes and even changing your developer will be a painless process.</p>\n<h4>Step 2</h4>\n<p>Great you have a awesome looking website, it functions well and is designed to capture your markets attention. Now the most important thing you can do is to market it. There are so many ways of marketing a website that diving into each of them in this article would be useless. I am sure that a quick Google search will provide you with hundreds of options. Don’t get overwhelmed here though look through all your options and chose three maybe four of them to master, and then get to work. A web agency might help you with these but there is no way if you have simply paid an up front cost of $X for your website that they will keep doing this indefinitely. Sure they might set up some basic SEO and do a little marketing to begin with but without a monthly fee you can be sure they aren’t doing anything. So you either need to do this yourself or get someone on board who will.</p>\n<h4>Finishing up</h4>\n<p>So with those two steps done you should be set. Knowing both sides of the story will help you and your business grow like never before. You’ll have a website that doesn’t look like rubbish and actually converts those that land on it, and you will actually have real humans looking at it to be converted. With these things done you’re set to bust into the big leagues.</p>\n<p>If you liked this article please click the 💚 below.

Well I am about to blow your mind with how quick and easy it is to make your website lightning fast! Oh and did I mention we are going to do this in just one step?</p>\n<p>Ok well maybe one step is a little bit of an exaggeration, but trust me it’s going to be quick, easy, and painless.</p>\n<h4>First thing’s first</h4>\n<p>Head on over to <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">cloudflare.com</a> and sign up for an account. Pretty easy so far right?</p>\n<h4>Next up</h4>\n<p>You’ll be asked to enter a website address. This should be the address of the website you want to speed up.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare will scan your name records and work its magic! and once that’s finished you are on your way.</p>\n<h4>Double Check</h4>\n<p>Alright this is the tricky bit and you better pay attention now. You will be shown a bunch of DNS records like the picture below. You need to make sure that the scan Cloudflare just did captured all of the records you have attached with your current DNS provider. I’d recommend logging into your DNS provider and double checking them against each other. If you skip this and a record is missing, you can be certain that some part of your website, emails, or business is going to be broken.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/999/1*z1KSlNbMChpvKZ_ZaRtgbw.png\"></figure><h4>Moving to Cloudflare</h4>\n<p>So you have made sure all your DNS records are there right? Great! You’re all set to move on and get started using Cloudflare. Follow their instructions for setting up their name servers with your name register. They have great guides and do a much better job than I could. Once this is done you are set. The name server change will slowly spread to all the DNS servers, like that rumor you started in high-school. Once it has finished spreading you are set. You’re using Cloudflare.</p>\n<h4>A few things left</h4>\n<p>Alright so you’re set up with Cloudflare but we’re not done yet. There’s 3 more things I want you to do to ensure that your site is super fast!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Minify</li>\n<li>Cache</li>\n<li>Page Rules</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When we have these three things done you know your site will be loading fast!</p>\n<h4>1. Minify</h4>\n<p>First things first I want you to head on over to the speed tab in your dashboard and make sure that you are auto minifying all your JS, CSS, and HTML. All this will do is strip out any unnecessary characters like comments from your data and squish it all onto less lines. This just helps these resources use less space, and less space means faster transfers!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*9y_qXju73RBIqBfedSODfg.png\"></figure><p>One big thing to watch out for is with the minification and especially the JS minification, sometimes if your code isn’t quite right the minification process will break it and you might need to dig around a little for that ; you missed.</p>\n<h4>2. Caching</h4>\n<p>Pay attention as this one is important. First before we play with any of these settings we are going to need to understand them a little first. The two settings on the cache tab that I want you to pay attention to are Browser Cache Expiration, and Caching Level.</p>\n<p>Browser Cache Expiration, this is how long a browser will keep your website files locally. Now this is where you are going to have to decide for yourself how long is right for you and your website. For me I have mine set for 1 day as I don’t have a lot of return visitors, you either get in touch with me about your project or you find someone else, you don’t come back that often. I could set it longer but I am always playing with little tweaks here and there on my site and if I change anything in the CSS and JS that is cached by a local machine, that my site requires to work properly. You’re going to see a messed up site or just nothing at all. Not a great look for a front end dev.</p>\n<p>If your site was a large news publication however you might want to set it longer as you have visitors coming back pretty often, hopefully daily. You also probably aren’t changing the look of your site as often. So you can let people keep the cached content longer, maybe a month or so.</p>\n<p>The next setting on this page we should look at is the caching level. This requires us to know a little about query strings. A query string would look something like http://jasonmatthew.me/form?name=jason This doesn’t actually do anything on my site but hopefully you get the idea. It tells the web server to do something with some information in the url. A common example of this is in the WordPress search functionality.</p>\n<p>Now we know what a query string is we have to decide what to do with them. Cloudflare gives us three options. If you don’t know 100% that your website doesn’t use query strings I would suggest that you leave this on standard.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare again has some really good documentation on this to <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168256-What-are-Cloudflare-s-caching-levels-\">take a look at</a> if you’re not sure or want to learn more.</p>\n<h4>3. Page Rules</h4>\n<p>This is where things get tricky. Below you can see my three page rules. We only want to pay attention to the first one however. In this we set the url to our site jasonmdesign.com/* where the * denotes anything. so everything will be cached. This means that all of our pages will be cached on the Cloudflare edge servers and on the users browser. Here you can also change these settings specifying the TTL or time to live for these cached resources.</p>\n<p>Again I will use the example of a news site here, because you are adding articles every few hours, or at least every day you probably don’t want to cache your home page or your blog page. To do this you could setup a page rule that looked something like jasonmdesign.com/blog/* this would only cache the articles in blog/ but not the blog itself assuming the blog is your home page.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/973/1*zyAjDmTA2Wx2_Lqn_7mXFw.png\"></figure><h4>Finishing up</h4>\n<p>With these setting changed you are well on your way to speeding up your site. Go and double check that all of these changes haven’t effected anything. A pro tip for this is to use the incognito option in your browser as this will eliminate and caching that has happened and show you what a brand new visitor would see and experience loading your site for the first time.</p>\n<p>I hope you have found this helpful, feel free to comment below if you have any questions, need a hand with setting this up, or just want to say hi.</p>\n<p>If you liked this article please click the 💚 below.

If you skip this and a record is missing, you can be certain that some part of your website, emails, or business is going to be broken.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/999/1*z1KSlNbMChpvKZ_ZaRtgbw.png\"></figure><h4>Moving to Cloudflare</h4>\n<p>So you have made sure all your DNS records are there right? Great! You’re all set to move on and get started using Cloudflare. Follow their instructions for setting up their name servers with your name register. They have great guides and do a much better job than I could. Once this is done you are set. The name server change will slowly spread to all the DNS servers, like that rumor you started in high-school. Once it has finished spreading you are set. You’re using Cloudflare.</p>\n<h4>A few things left</h4>\n<p>Alright so you’re set up with Cloudflare but we’re not done yet. There’s 3 more things I want you to do to ensure that your site is super fast!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Minify</li>\n<li>Cache</li>\n<li>Page Rules</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When we have these three things done you know your site will be loading fast!</p>\n<h4>1. Minify</h4>\n<p>First things first I want you to head on over to the speed tab in your dashboard and make sure that you are auto minifying all your JS, CSS, and HTML. All this will do is strip out any unnecessary characters like comments from your data and squish it all onto less lines. This just helps these resources use less space, and less space means faster transfers!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*9y_qXju73RBIqBfedSODfg.png\"></figure><p>One big thing to watch out for is with the minification and especially the JS minification, sometimes if your code isn’t quite right the minification process will break it and you might need to dig around a little for that ; you missed.</p>\n<h4>2. Caching</h4>\n<p>Pay attention as this one is important. First before we play with any of these settings we are going to need to understand them a little first. The two settings on the cache tab that I want you to pay attention to are Browser Cache Expiration, and Caching Level.</p>\n<p>Browser Cache Expiration, this is how long a browser will keep your website files locally. Now this is where you are going to have to decide for yourself how long is right for you and your website. For me I have mine set for 1 day as I don’t have a lot of return visitors, you either get in touch with me about your project or you find someone else, you don’t come back that often. I could set it longer but I am always playing with little tweaks here and there on my site and if I change anything in the CSS and JS that is cached by a local machine, that my site requires to work properly. You’re going to see a messed up site or just nothing at all. Not a great look for a front end dev.</p>\n<p>If your site was a large news publication however you might want to set it longer as you have visitors coming back pretty often, hopefully daily. You also probably aren’t changing the look of your site as often. So you can let people keep the cached content longer, maybe a month or so.</p>\n<p>The next setting on this page we should look at is the caching level. This requires us to know a little about query strings. A query string would look something like http://jasonmatthew.me/form?name=jason This doesn’t actually do anything on my site but hopefully you get the idea. It tells the web server to do something with some information in the url. A common example of this is in the WordPress search functionality.</p>\n<p>Now we know what a query string is we have to decide what to do with them. Cloudflare gives us three options. If you don’t know 100% that your website doesn’t use query strings I would suggest that you leave this on standard.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare again has some really good documentation on this to <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168256-What-are-Cloudflare-s-caching-levels-\">take a look at</a> if you’re not sure or want to learn more.</p>\n<h4>3. Page Rules</h4>\n<p>This is where things get tricky. Below you can see my three page rules. We only want to pay attention to the first one however. In this we set the url to our site jasonmdesign.com/* where the * denotes anything. so everything will be cached. This means that all of our pages will be cached on the Cloudflare edge servers and on the users browser. Here you can also change these settings specifying the TTL or time to live for these cached resources.</p>\n<p>Again I will use the example of a news site here, because you are adding articles every few hours, or at least every day you probably don’t want to cache your home page or your blog page. To do this you could setup a page rule that looked something like jasonmdesign.com/blog/* this would only cache the articles in blog/ but not the blog itself assuming the blog is your home page.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/973/1*zyAjDmTA2Wx2_Lqn_7mXFw.png\"></figure><h4>Finishing up</h4>\n<p>With these setting changed you are well on your way to speeding up your site. Go and double check that all of these changes haven’t effected anything. A pro tip for this is to use the incognito option in your browser as this will eliminate and caching that has happened and show you what a brand new visitor would see and experience loading your site for the first time.</p>\n<p>I hope you have found this helpful, feel free to comment below if you have any questions, need a hand with setting this up, or just want to say hi.</p>\n<p>If you liked this article please click the 💚 below.

Today I think I found my answer!</p>\n<p>So we all know that medium is a great place to host your blog for a number of reasons. So much so that I’m not going to go into them today more than simply saying you need to be posting here.</p>\n<p>But.. There is something special about having your articles on your own website that makes you the owner. That makes you feel in control. Now there is of course the import functionality of medium where a post will get brought into the system and then linked back to your original site or wherever it came from. This is good but not ideal, if you have to manually do it for every article you write.</p>\n<p>A better option provided weather you are using WordPress or another CMS platform or even a static site generator like Jekyll is to use some form of plugin to automatically preform the import functionality whenever you publish a new post. This is a better alternative, but still not quite there.</p>\n<p>When I think about the above alternative their biggest shortcomings is that you are still building your following in two different places. Sure these places are thinly linked but it’s still not idea. Enter my solution…</p>\n<h3>Embed your Medium posts on your website</h3>\n<p>For the amount of medium users out there I am really surprised at the lack of information available on this. Don’t fear however, it’s quite simple to do once you know what needs to be done.</p>\n<h4>Step 1: Get your JSON</h4>\n<p>The first thing we are going to need to embed our posts is said posts in a computer readable format.</p>\n<p>Your first instinct might be to tag a “latest?format=json” query onto the end of your user or publication, but this isn’t going to help us much. While it will get the JSON that we need. It won’t help because Medium will throw a CORS error. Which basically means that we cant use anything from the Medium domain on our own site. Bummer…</p>\n<p>What now? There is a handy site called <a href=\"https://rss2json.com/\">rsstojson.com</a> which will convert our RSS feed which Medium can provide into the JSON we need. This site is handy for learning what needs to be done and for the docs contained there but since I will be providing the code we don’t actually need to do anything there yet.</p>\n<h4>Step 2: Using the Json</h4>\n<p>To use the API that rsstojson provide we need to first include jQuery this is easy enough and you’ve probably already done it. If not however simply include it by having the code:</p>\n<pre>&lt;script src=\"<a href=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js\">https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js</a>\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>At the end of your body element. After we have included jQuery we are all set to start using the provided API. The code below shows a simple example where the API will convert the feed from techcrunch.com to JSON and then output this into the div with an id of content.</p>\n<pre>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;<br>    $(function() {<br>        var $content = $('#content');<br>        var data = {<br>            rss_url: 'https://techcrunch.com/feed/'<br>        };</pre>\n<pre>$.get('https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json', data, function(response) {<br>            if (response.status == 'ok') {<br>                var output = '&lt;h1&gt;' + response.feed.title + '&lt;/h1&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>$.each(response.items, function(k, item) {<br>                    output += '&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"' + item.link + '\" &gt;' + item.title + '&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;';<br>                    output += '&lt;p&gt;' + item.description + '&lt;/p&gt;';<br>                });</pre>\n<pre>$content.html(output);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>});</pre>\n<pre>});<br>&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>Since this will require some modifications let’s dive into the actual code. The snippet below will define our variables first the element on the page that we want the output to be displayed in #content, then the actual feed that we want parsed. Being techcrunch.com. You will want to change this url variable to that of your medium feed. For me this was <a href=\"https://medium.jasonmdesign.com/feed\">https://medium.jasonmdesign.com/feed</a> as I was using my publication. But if you wanted it for just your personal user it would be <a href=\"https://medium.com/feed/@Medium\">medium.com/feed/@Medium</a> where @Medium is your username. More info on this can be found <a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874118-RSS-feeds\">here</a> in the medium documentation.</p>\n<pre>var $content = $('#content');<br>var data = {<br>  rss_url: 'https://techcrunch.com/feed/'<br>};</pre>\n<p>With these changes made we are ready to start bringing in our content.</p>\n<pre>$.get('https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json', data, function(response) {<br>            if (response.status == 'ok') {<br>                var output = '&lt;h1&gt;' + response.feed.title + '&lt;/h1&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>$.each(response.items, function(k, item) {<br>                    output += '&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"' + item.link + '\" &gt;' + item.title + '&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;';<br>                    output += '&lt;p&gt;' + item.description + '&lt;/p&gt;';<br>                });</pre>\n<pre>$content.html(output);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>});</pre>\n<p>These lines parse the data from the rss then output as JSON. This JSON is then used and and appended to the output variable. First the feed title is added as a h1 element. After this for each of the items, or posts a heading is added as a h2 element that is linked to the url and followed by the description as a paragraph.</p>\n<p>This works fine for a tidy rss feed like tech crunch but the provided rss from Medium isn’t so nice so we need to make some changes to tidy it up a little.</p>\n<h4>Step 3: Tidying up the output</h4>\n<p>With an understanding of how the rss to json api is working we are ready to tidy up our feed and get everything we want from Medium.</p>\n<p>Below is the actual code that I am using:</p>\n<pre>$(<em>function</em> () {</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> $content = $('#jsonContent');</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> data = {</pre>\n<pre>rss_url: 'https://medium.jasonmdesign.com/feed'</pre>\n<pre>};</pre>\n<pre>$.get('https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json', data, <em>function</em> (<em>response</em>) {</pre>\n<pre>if (response.status == 'ok') {</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> output = '';</pre>\n<pre>$.each(response.items, <em>function</em> (<em>k</em>, <em>item</em>) {</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> visibleSm;</pre>\n<pre>if(k &lt; 3){</pre>\n<pre>visibleSm = '';</pre>\n<pre>} else {</pre>\n<pre>visibleSm = ' visible-sm';</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"col-sm-6 col-md-4' + visibleSm + '\"&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"blog-post\"&gt;&lt;header&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;h4 class=\"date\"&gt;' + $.format.date(item.pubDate, \"dd&lt;br&gt;MMM\") + \"&lt;/h4&gt;\";</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> tagIndex = item.description.indexOf('&lt;img'); // Find where the img tag starts</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcIndex = item.description.substring(tagIndex).indexOf('src=') + tagIndex; // Find where the src attribute starts</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcStart = srcIndex + 5; // Find where the actual image URL starts; 5 for the length of 'src=\"'</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcEnd = item.description.substring(srcStart).indexOf('\"') + srcStart; // Find where the URL ends</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> src = item.description.substring(srcStart, srcEnd); // Extract just the URL</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"blog-element\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"' + src + '\" width=\"360px\" height=\"240px\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/header&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"blog-content\"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=\"'+ item.link + '\"&gt;' + item.title + '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"post-meta\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By ' + item.author + '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> yourString = item.description.replace(/&lt;img[^&gt;]*&gt;/g,\"\");</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> maxLength = 120 // maximum number of characters to extract</pre>\n<pre>//trim the string to the maximum length</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> trimmedString = yourString.substr(0, maxLength);</pre>\n<pre>//re-trim if we are in the middle of a word</pre>\n<pre>trimmedString = trimmedString.substr(0, Math.min(trimmedString.length, trimmedString.lastIndexOf(\" \")))</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;p&gt;' + trimmedString + '...&lt;/p&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>return k &lt; 3;</pre>\n<pre>});</pre>\n<pre>$content.html(output);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>});</pre>\n<pre>});</pre>\n<p>The important parts are still the same but we have clearly made some changes. Using the jQuery date format plugin found <a href=\"https://github.com/phstc/jquery-dateFormat\">here</a> we are able to format the date given to us from medium however we like according to its documentation. This can be seen below.</p>\n<pre>output += '&lt;h4 class=\"date\"&gt;' + $.format.date(item.pubDate, \"dd&lt;br&gt;MMM\") + \"&lt;/h4&gt;\";</pre>\n<p>Next you probably want to display some kind of thumbnail. Now Medium doesn’t give you your thumbnail source it’s only included as an image in your post (if you included it that is) so we want to snatch this up. To do this we had to play around using jQuery to sort through our description and find the first image tag then grab the source from this and use it to display our thumbnail.</p>\n<pre><em>var</em> tagIndex = item.description.indexOf('&lt;img'); // Find where the img tag starts</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcIndex = item.description.substring(tagIndex).indexOf('src=') + tagIndex; // Find where the src attribute starts</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcStart = srcIndex + 5; // Find where the actual image URL starts; 5 for the length of 'src=\"'</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcEnd = item.description.substring(srcStart).indexOf('\"') + srcStart; // Find where the URL ends</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> src = item.description.substring(srcStart, srcEnd); // Extract just the URL</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"blog-element\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"' + src + '\" width=\"360px\" height=\"240px\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/header&gt;';</pre>\n<p>The title link and author are pretty self explanatory so there is no need to go into detail on these however the description is also a little tricky with images being included, and the entire article parsed. So we first remove any images from the content.</p>\n<pre><em>var</em> yourString = item.description.replace(/&lt;img[^&gt;]*&gt;/g,\"\");</pre>\n<p>After this we set a max length in the number of characters we want included. This is pretty good but we also don’t want a word to be chopped off in the middle so we make sure that this doesn't happen also by re-trimming the description if we are in the middle of a word.</p>\n<pre><em>var</em> maxLength = 120 // maximum number of characters to extract</pre>\n<pre>//trim the string to the maximum length</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> trimmedString = yourString.substr(0, maxLength);</pre>\n<pre>//re-trim if we are in the middle of a word</pre>\n<pre>trimmedString = trimmedString.substr(0, Math.min(trimmedString.length, trimmedString.lastIndexOf(\" \")))</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;p&gt;' + trimmedString + '...&lt;/p&gt;';</pre>\n<p>Last of all we want to finish the loop if a certain number of posts is reached so we use a return to end the loop.</p>\n<pre>return k &lt; 3;</pre>\n<p>This return finishes the loop at 4 posts but can be changed to however many or few you need or omitted completely if you want all of your posts.</p>\n<p>The last thing we do is append the outputted html to the content tag defined earlier.</p>\n<pre>$content.html(output);</pre>\n<h4>Finishing things up</h4>\n<p>Hopefully now you have everything up and running and your Medium posts are displaying on your own website. If not I have a CodePen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/jasonm4130/pen/vZYbQx\">https://codepen.io/jasonm4130/pen/vZYbQx</a> which might be able to help you get some more insight.

More info on this can be found <a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874118-RSS-feeds\">here</a> in the medium documentation.</p>\n<pre>var $content = $('#content');<br>var data = {<br>  rss_url: 'https://techcrunch.com/feed/'<br>};</pre>\n<p>With these changes made we are ready to start bringing in our content.</p>\n<pre>$.get('https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json', data, function(response) {<br>            if (response.status == 'ok') {<br>                var output = '&lt;h1&gt;' + response.feed.title + '&lt;/h1&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>$.each(response.items, function(k, item) {<br>                    output += '&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"' + item.link + '\" &gt;' + item.title + '&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;';<br>                    output += '&lt;p&gt;' + item.description + '&lt;/p&gt;';<br>                });</pre>\n<pre>$content.html(output);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>});</pre>\n<p>These lines parse the data from the rss then output as JSON. This JSON is then used and and appended to the output variable. First the feed title is added as a h1 element. After this for each of the items, or posts a heading is added as a h2 element that is linked to the url and followed by the description as a paragraph.</p>\n<p>This works fine for a tidy rss feed like tech crunch but the provided rss from Medium isn’t so nice so we need to make some changes to tidy it up a little.</p>\n<h4>Step 3: Tidying up the output</h4>\n<p>With an understanding of how the rss to json api is working we are ready to tidy up our feed and get everything we want from Medium.</p>\n<p>Below is the actual code that I am using:</p>\n<pre>$(<em>function</em> () {</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> $content = $('#jsonContent');</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> data = {</pre>\n<pre>rss_url: 'https://medium.jasonmdesign.com/feed'</pre>\n<pre>};</pre>\n<pre>$.get('https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json', data, <em>function</em> (<em>response</em>) {</pre>\n<pre>if (response.status == 'ok') {</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> output = '';</pre>\n<pre>$.each(response.items, <em>function</em> (<em>k</em>, <em>item</em>) {</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> visibleSm;</pre>\n<pre>if(k &lt; 3){</pre>\n<pre>visibleSm = '';</pre>\n<pre>} else {</pre>\n<pre>visibleSm = ' visible-sm';</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"col-sm-6 col-md-4' + visibleSm + '\"&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"blog-post\"&gt;&lt;header&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;h4 class=\"date\"&gt;' + $.format.date(item.pubDate, \"dd&lt;br&gt;MMM\") + \"&lt;/h4&gt;\";</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> tagIndex = item.description.indexOf('&lt;img'); // Find where the img tag starts</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcIndex = item.description.substring(tagIndex).indexOf('src=') + tagIndex; // Find where the src attribute starts</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcStart = srcIndex + 5; // Find where the actual image URL starts; 5 for the length of 'src=\"'</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcEnd = item.description.substring(srcStart).indexOf('\"') + srcStart; // Find where the URL ends</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> src = item.description.substring(srcStart, srcEnd); // Extract just the URL</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"blog-element\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"' + src + '\" width=\"360px\" height=\"240px\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/header&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"blog-content\"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=\"'+ item.link + '\"&gt;' + item.title + '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"post-meta\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By ' + item.author + '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> yourString = item.description.replace(/&lt;img[^&gt;]*&gt;/g,\"\");</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> maxLength = 120 // maximum number of characters to extract</pre>\n<pre>//trim the string to the maximum length</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> trimmedString = yourString.substr(0, maxLength);</pre>\n<pre>//re-trim if we are in the middle of a word</pre>\n<pre>trimmedString = trimmedString.substr(0, Math.min(trimmedString.length, trimmedString.lastIndexOf(\" \")))</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;p&gt;' + trimmedString + '...&lt;/p&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';</pre>\n<pre>return k &lt; 3;</pre>\n<pre>});</pre>\n<pre>$content.html(output);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>});</pre>\n<pre>});</pre>\n<p>The important parts are still the same but we have clearly made some changes. Using the jQuery date format plugin found <a href=\"https://github.com/phstc/jquery-dateFormat\">here</a> we are able to format the date given to us from medium however we like according to its documentation. This can be seen below.</p>\n<pre>output += '&lt;h4 class=\"date\"&gt;' + $.format.date(item.pubDate, \"dd&lt;br&gt;MMM\") + \"&lt;/h4&gt;\";</pre>\n<p>Next you probably want to display some kind of thumbnail. Now Medium doesn’t give you your thumbnail source it’s only included as an image in your post (if you included it that is) so we want to snatch this up. To do this we had to play around using jQuery to sort through our description and find the first image tag then grab the source from this and use it to display our thumbnail.</p>\n<pre><em>var</em> tagIndex = item.description.indexOf('&lt;img'); // Find where the img tag starts</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcIndex = item.description.substring(tagIndex).indexOf('src=') + tagIndex; // Find where the src attribute starts</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcStart = srcIndex + 5; // Find where the actual image URL starts; 5 for the length of 'src=\"'</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> srcEnd = item.description.substring(srcStart).indexOf('\"') + srcStart; // Find where the URL ends</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> src = item.description.substring(srcStart, srcEnd); // Extract just the URL</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;div class=\"blog-element\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"' + src + '\" width=\"360px\" height=\"240px\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/header&gt;';</pre>\n<p>The title link and author are pretty self explanatory so there is no need to go into detail on these however the description is also a little tricky with images being included, and the entire article parsed. So we first remove any images from the content.</p>\n<pre><em>var</em> yourString = item.description.replace(/&lt;img[^&gt;]*&gt;/g,\"\");</pre>\n<p>After this we set a max length in the number of characters we want included. This is pretty good but we also don’t want a word to be chopped off in the middle so we make sure that this doesn't happen also by re-trimming the description if we are in the middle of a word.</p>\n<pre><em>var</em> maxLength = 120 // maximum number of characters to extract</pre>\n<pre>//trim the string to the maximum length</pre>\n<pre><em>var</em> trimmedString = yourString.substr(0, maxLength);</pre>\n<pre>//re-trim if we are in the middle of a word</pre>\n<pre>trimmedString = trimmedString.substr(0, Math.min(trimmedString.length, trimmedString.lastIndexOf(\" \")))</pre>\n<pre>output += '&lt;p&gt;' + trimmedString + '...&lt;/p&gt;';</pre>\n<p>Last of all we want to finish the loop if a certain number of posts is reached so we use a return to end the loop.</p>\n<pre>return k &lt; 3;</pre>\n<p>This return finishes the loop at 4 posts but can be changed to however many or few you need or omitted completely if you want all of your posts.</p>\n<p>The last thing we do is append the outputted html to the content tag defined earlier.</p>\n<pre>$content.html(output);</pre>\n<h4>Finishing things up</h4>\n<p>Hopefully now you have everything up and running and your Medium posts are displaying on your own website. If not I have a CodePen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/jasonm4130/pen/vZYbQx\">https://codepen.io/jasonm4130/pen/vZYbQx</a> which might be able to help you get some more insight.

While researching these it made me realise something very important. They have almost no barrier to entry for web professionals. This low barrier to entry for particular markets is exactly why you need to go outside.</p>\n<h3>Barrier to entry, what is it?</h3>\n<p>The best way I can describe a barrier to entry is by describing a scenario. Imagine there is this beautiful park, where all our friends and family are playing. You naturally want to go and play there with them too. Unfortunately there is something stopping you. A huge fence with no way around. You either have to climb over, or dig under. This fence is your barrier to entry for the park.</p>\n<p>Barriers to entry aren’t just for parks though they could be for anything. Take tertiary education for example, a barrier to entry for many students is their grades during high school, or another barrier could be their financial situation. Both of these can be overcome but they make it a little harder for everyone to go to University or college. These are barriers to entry.</p>\n<h3>Why a barrier to entry matters?</h3>\n<p>So to illustrate a barrier to entry I have thought of a scenario. Well two scenarios in fact, both very similar in many aspects but with a few slight changes that make all the difference.</p>\n<h3>Scenario 1</h3>\n<p>You visit a market on the weekend, there are store owners and it’s generally a great atmosphere. The store owners yell out about the great deals they are offering and their amazing products. Some owners selling amazing pottery, other the most beautiful jewelry, and even others selling the finest foods. It’s a great atmosphere, you come here often and make purchases every now and then.</p>\n<h3>Scenario 2</h3>\n<p>Similar to scenario 1 you are at a market. This time it’s different though, the store owners are all selling exactly the same things. They all say that their thing is different to the others, better even. They describe the differences in words you don’t really understand but know are important. They even try and show you the difference but you still can’t really see it more than just the superficial impact that it has. It’s not a very enjoyable for you or for them.</p>\n<h3>Where you fit in.</h3>\n<p>Thinking about these scenarios, and about web professionals. The barrier to entry for a web professional to advertise online is so low that every web professional is doing it. It ends up as a market place with everyone selling essentially the same thing, which just confuses buyers even more. There is a reason that 80% of web professionals find their clients through referrals. It’s because they have distinguished themselves from the crowd by being trusted by a third party.</p>\n<p>Now I’m not saying that the only way for web professionals to market is through offline means, because it’s not. Marketing online can be very effective if done right. But the emphasis needs to be on the done right, not on being done half baked with some good ideas thrown into the mix, you’re wasting your time.</p>\n<p>So go spend some time outside, and meet some new people.

He is working on building his first custom WordPress website. I was talking with him about how he was doing it, and how I have built websites in the past. The topic turned to the plugins he was using. As it would be the tools he was using were similar to those I had used to build sites.</p>\n<p>We talked about them, and I shared how I had included Advanced Custom Fields with my theme. I felt it made a more concise and eloquent solution than having to install the plugin when the theme was installed. He had never heard of doing this, and I remember it took me a while to figure out how to do this myself. So in the hope of lessening someone’s learning curve, I am sharing with you now.</p>\n<p>So to get us started, why would you want to include a plugin with a theme rather than installing it separately? Well, there are arguments for and against, I will just talk about why I made my choice. I think a plugin that adds functionality and is essential to the theme you are building should be included with it. If it’s needed for the theme to function then you would never have an instance with the theme installed and not the plugin, so it seems silly to have to install both.</p>\n<p>As I walk you through this process I will be using the advanced custom fields plugin as an example, but the process should be similar if not the same for other plugins too. If you don’t know what Advanced Custom Fields is, you should. Every WordPress developer at some stage has used it, wanted to use it, should have used it, or will use it.</p>\n<p>So let’s get started. First off you are going to need to get the plugin downloaded you can do this from the WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\">plugin directory</a>. Or from the advanced custom fields <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>With this downloaded, we need to extract the contents of the zip file and place it somewhere within the theme folder. For me, I chose /inc/plugins I also renamed the advanced custom fields folder to just ACF to make it easier to reference later.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/425/0*euHuox4XGUxsedIJ.jpg\"></figure><p>With the contents of the plugin installed we need to include the main php file of the plugin in the functions.php of our theme.</p>\n<p>To do this we go to add some code to our functions.php (Obviously)</p>\n<pre>// 1. customize ACF path add_filter(‘acf/settings/path’, ‘my_acf_settings_path’); function my_acf_settings_path( $path ) { // update path $path = get_stylesheet_directory() . ‘/inc/plugins/acf/’; // return return $path; }</pre>\n<p>This first bit of code changes the path for the advanced custom fields settings. Notice the only part that you will need to change from this is the $path variable, where ‘/inc/plugins/acf/’ should represent your folder structure.</p>\n<p>The next section of code we add does a similar thing to that above except it changed the location of the directory for ACF. Again the only part that requires changing is the $dir path to represent your folder structure.</p>\n<pre>// 2. customize ACF dir add_filter(‘acf/settings/dir’, ‘my_acf_settings_dir’); function my_acf_settings_dir( $dir ) { // update path $dir = get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . ‘/inc/plugins/acf/’; // return return $dir; }</pre>\n<p>These two parts of code above are specific for advanced custom fields and for other plugins may not be required, or they may require different filters to be passed to them.</p>\n<p>This next piece of code will be similar if not the same for including every plugin within your theme. In it we actually include the main php file of the plugin. In this case that is acf.php. Here again you will need to change the code to match your folder structure, and the name of the php file we are including to match whatever plugin it is that you are including.</p>\n<pre>// 3. Include ACF include_once( get_stylesheet_directory() . ‘/inc/plugins/acf/acf.php’ );</pre>\n<p>If all this has gone well you should be able to save your functions.php and reload your browser and have advanced custom fields included with your theme.</p>\n<p>If you liked this article please click the ❤ below.

            "content": "\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*14em1t8BjKdYfpZ-.jpg\"></figure><p>Today I was talking with a friend in a Slack community that I am a part of. He is working on building his first custom WordPress website. I was talking with him about how he was doing it, and how I have built websites in the past. The topic turned to the plugins he was using. As it would be the tools he was using were similar to those I had used to build sites.</p>\n<p>We talked about them, and I shared how I had included Advanced Custom Fields with my theme. I felt it made a more concise and eloquent solution than having to install the plugin when the theme was installed. He had never heard of doing this, and I remember it took me a while to figure out how to do this myself. So in the hope of lessening someone’s learning curve, I am sharing with you now.</p>\n<p>So to get us started, why would you want to include a plugin with a theme rather than installing it separately? Well, there are arguments for and against, I will just talk about why I made my choice. I think a plugin that adds functionality and is essential to the theme you are building should be included with it. If it’s needed for the theme to function then you would never have an instance with the theme installed and not the plugin, so it seems silly to have to install both.</p>\n<p>As I walk you through this process I will be using the advanced custom fields plugin as an example, but the process should be similar if not the same for other plugins too. If you don’t know what Advanced Custom Fields is, you should. Every WordPress developer at some stage has used it, wanted to use it, should have used it, or will use it.</p>\n<p>So let’s get started. First off you are going to need to get the plugin downloaded you can do this from the WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\">plugin directory</a>. Or from the advanced custom fields <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>With this downloaded, we need to extract the contents of the zip file and place it somewhere within the theme folder. For me, I chose /inc/plugins I also renamed the advanced custom fields folder to just ACF to make it easier to reference later.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/425/0*euHuox4XGUxsedIJ.jpg\"></figure><p>With the contents of the plugin installed we need to include the main php file of the plugin in the functions.php of our theme.</p>\n<p>To do this we go to add some code to our functions.php (Obviously)</p>\n<pre>// 1. customize ACF path add_filter(‘acf/settings/path’, ‘my_acf_settings_path’); function my_acf_settings_path( $path ) { // update path $path = get_stylesheet_directory() . ‘/inc/plugins/acf/’; // return return $path; }</pre>\n<p>This first bit of code changes the path for the advanced custom fields settings. Notice the only part that you will need to change from this is the $path variable, where ‘/inc/plugins/acf/’ should represent your folder structure.</p>\n<p>The next section of code we add does a similar thing to that above except it changed the location of the directory for ACF. Again the only part that requires changing is the $dir path to represent your folder structure.</p>\n<pre>// 2. customize ACF dir add_filter(‘acf/settings/dir’, ‘my_acf_settings_dir’); function my_acf_settings_dir( $dir ) { // update path $dir = get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . ‘/inc/plugins/acf/’; // return return $dir; }</pre>\n<p>These two parts of code above are specific for advanced custom fields and for other plugins may not be required, or they may require different filters to be passed to them.</p>\n<p>This next piece of code will be similar if not the same for including every plugin within your theme. In it we actually include the main php file of the plugin. In this case that is acf.php. Here again you will need to change the code to match your folder structure, and the name of the php file we are including to match whatever plugin it is that you are including.</p>\n<pre>// 3. Include ACF include_once( get_stylesheet_directory() . ‘/inc/plugins/acf/acf.php’ );</pre>\n<p>If all this has gone well you should be able to save your functions.php and reload your browser and have advanced custom fields included with your theme.</p>\n<p>If you liked this article please click the ❤ below.

When a website loads slowly the sites visitors become impatient and this leads to an overall bad impression and experience. Today however I want to share a few things that I have found to improve page load times and overall speed.</p>\n<h3>A Good Host</h3>\n<p>A web host is the foundation for your website, it is the bedrock that everything else is built upon. Without a good web host you are very unlikely to make big differences in your websites speed, however it is still possible to make some improvements to your websites speed.</p>\n<p>How to find a good web host? This question gets a little harder to answer in a broad sense, because there is no one size fits all answer to this question. There is no one best web host because every website is different and it’s this difference that means that you will need to decide based on factors for yourself which is best. Factors such as price, support, speed, and services like backups and email options.</p>\n<p>A good web host will also take care of a lot of things that you would otherwise have to do like website caching, compressing and use of a content delivery network.</p>\n<p>So with that said, Flywheel is the host that I use because they are able to supply a super fast server optimized for WordPress, and take care of a lot of the finer details of speed optimization. Sure there are cheaper hosts with more options but they fit exactly what I need. A Fast web host with a focus on helping web designers and their clients to receive the best possible service that they can. Visit their website.</p>\n<h3>Good Code</h3>\n<p>To me good html, css, js and php is something that should be optimized for every website. It is a shame to see a beautiful website that has un-optimized code, although this is rarely the site owners fault but related back to the designer and developer. Optimizing website code is simple and easy when you know what you are doing however without thought at the beginning of a project it can be a big hassle to fix.</p>\n<p>So for you as a user there isn’t a whole heap of optimization that you can do for this without an in-depth knowledge, however there are still things that you can do. A must have in my opinion is JS &amp; CSS Script Optimizer. This is a WordPress plugin that optimizes these parts of your website for you automatically. There are other plugins out there that do the same thing but this is the only one that I have found that has worked for me every time I have used it. This plugin combines all the css and javascript that your website uses into a single file for each and then removes anything that is unnecessary from these files so that they are as small as possible and thus load as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Another thing that I like to do when creating websites is I make sure that if I am using any third party css or js like bootstrap or JQuery that I use the scripts from their CDN network as this is a much faster way to fetch these file than from off your own server.</p>\n<h3>Image Optimization</h3>\n<p>Images can make a website much slower if they are used incorrectly with file sizes upwards of 2mb for some images it would be ridiculous to use a 4000 x 2600 image on a website. So how do you fix this? Well what I like to do is first before the images ever get uploaded to my website I make sure that they are at an acceptable size, one that will offer a good quality image but keep the image size to a minimum. To do this I use Photoshop and use the export as function and play around with sizes and file formats until I find something that works well. As a general rule of thumb though I like to make sure that for a high quality image I don’t go bigger than 1920 x 1080 and aim for under 300kb in size. This is relatively easy to achieve while still having a high quality image.</p>\n<p>On top of this optimization I use a plugin called ewww image optimizer this plugin comes in two flavors a cloud based service and a server-based one. I use the cloud based optimization allowing less load to be placed on the web server that I use. The cloud option does cost a small sum of money but it is well worth the initial investment.</p>\n<h3>Plugins</h3>\n<p>After talking about a few plugins above I wanted to share a little more here about them. Never use a plugin for simple functionality, this will always slow down your website. Let me repeat that, avoid using plugins as much as possible. Before you install a plugin thing really hard about if you actually need it and what benefit you are actually gaining from it.</p>\n<p>Some plugins are necessary or even essential but the majority of them are used to add things to your website that aren’t essential and sometimes don’t even add any value to your site. I have never made a website that I have needed more than 10 plugins. This is including the basics like the two described above along with SEO plugins.</p>\n<p>So basically what I am saying is if you need it add it but unless its vital to your website it will probably be doing more harm than good.</p>\n<h3>Testing</h3>\n<p>The last thing that you should do when optimizing your WordPress website for speed is test it. I like to use both Pingdom and GTmetrix these are both online websites that allow you to test the loading times of your website, they also suggest changes that you can make to your website that would help improve these metrics.</p>\n<p>So to wrap up you need to start with a great web host like Flywheel, then make sure that your web designer or developer is thinking about speed from the beginning. After that you want to make sure that you are optimizing the images, css and js for the fasted load times possible. On top of this you should be carefully thinking about the plugins that you install on your website. Then once these things are done test your website. See how much it has improved and check if there is anything else that you can do to Optimize your WordPress website more.</p>\n<p>If you liked this article please click the ❤ below.
